macOS EQ that saves custom tracks for your songs. 

DEMO & FEATURES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0UMWOYk3M&feature=youtu.be (2 min)

This project was done on a tight time frame for me (hackathon), so keep that in mind. Remnants of old features still remain in the code, ignore them.

The project was originaly going to integrate with SoundCloud or Spotify, but I could not get an API key for free.

## Tech used:
* AudioUnit

* CoreAudio

* App Kit

## What I learned:
* macOS development, which is a surprising departure from iOS.

* A lot about audio on macOS

* View controllers in macOS: NSVerticalSplitView, container views...

* NSOpenPanel & other file interactions 

* async (for audio things)

* mp3 metadata

* NSControl

* How to fix a whole lot of problems that people have while working with audio. I should go post my findings on StackOverflow...
